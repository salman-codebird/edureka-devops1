Devops is basically a software development strategy which bridges the gap between dev side and ops side.
various stages and tools are involvede in devops. Evrythinh happens continuosly in devops. Starting from coding, testing , deplymenting, monitoring . everything happens continuosly.
plan, code	git tool
build		maven
Test		Se, gradle
Integration 	jenkins
deploy,operate	docker,puppet,ansible,chef
monitor		nagios,stack,splunk

you should know where to use this tools, how to use this tools to get max out od devops.

Various stages involved:
	Version control/source code management :-maintains different versions of the code
	
	continuous integration / continuous build :- compile, validate, code review, unit testing, integration testing

	conti. delivery/conti. testing :- deploying build apps to test servers
	
	cont. deployment/ config. managemnt and containirization: deploying testedapps on the prod server for release



source code management

	the management of changes to documents, computer programs, large websites, and other collection of information

	2 types
	
	centralized version control system
	distributed 				
	
	working copy -> commit to shared central repository
	working copy -> commit to local repo ->  push to server	

git

	cd to working dir
	git init
	git add <file name>
	git status

	git commit -m "message you want"    added to local repository
	ssh key gen:
		ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "email@gmail.com"

	git remote add origin "your remote repo"

	git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories

	git push origin master
	git pull origin master

	after edit:
	k8s@master-cks:~/Desktop/edureka$ git add introduction.txt 
k8s@master-cks:~/Desktop/edureka$ git commit -m "second commit"
[master 9d87275] second commit
